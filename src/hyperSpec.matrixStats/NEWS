FUNCTIONALITY:

o plotc is now a lattice function

o plotc and plotmap gained a standard formula interface

o plotvoronoi is an alternative to plotmap for non-rectangularly spaced grids

o plot (x, "mat") is an abbreviation to plot the spectra matrix

o The special handling of MARGINS in apply changed to be more consistent with standard behaviour
  apply (x, 1 : 2, FUN, ...) is now calling FUN for each element of the spectra matrix, and
  apply (x, , FUN, ...) calls FUN with the complete spectra matrix.

o hyperSpec now reads the binary file formats .spc as well as ENVI files.  
  There are two specialized functions to import Nicolet FTIR Images (ENVI) and Kaiser Raman maps
  (spc)

o collapse rbinds a list of hyperSpec object that may have different wavelength axes

o a more general way to combine two hyperSpec objects is merge.

DOCUMENTATION:

o Plotting functions are discussed in a separate vignette "plotting" now

o Import- and Export functions for diverse file formats are discussed in vignette "fileio"

Title: Interface for hyperspectral data, i.e. spectra + meta info (spatial, time, concentration, ...)

Description: This package is an interface to handle hyperspectral data sets in R.  I.e. spatially or
				 time-resolved spectra, or spectra with any other kind of information associated with
				 each of the spectra. The spectra can be data as obtained in XRF, UV/VIS, Fluorescence,
				 AES, NIR, IR, Raman, NMR, MS, etc. More generally, any data that is recorded over a
				 discretized variable, e.g. absorbance = f (wavelength), stored as a vector of absorbance
				 values for discrete wavelengths is suitable.

Description: This package gives an interface to handle hyperspectral data sets in R. I.e. spatially or time-resolved spectra, or spectra with any other kind of information associated with the spectra. The spectra can be data as obtained in XRF, UV/VIS, Fluorescence, AES, NIR, IR, Raman, NMR, MS, etc. More generally, any data that is recorded over a discretized variable, e.g. absorbance = f (wavelength), stored as a vector of absorbance values for discrete wavelengths is suitable.

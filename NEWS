User-visible changes 

o new file import functions, (see vignette fileio) 
  - scan.txt.Witec: Witec ASCII files
  - read.jdx.Shimadzu: JCAMP-DX as produced by Shimadzu's GCxGC-MS library 
    (experimental)
  - read.txt.Shimadzu: ASCII files exported by Shimadzu Chrome Solution

o hyperSpec gains a subset method

o bugfix for stacked plots: y axis labels were in wrong order in some cases

o recycling in initialize: columns may (again) be initialized with a single 
  value

o levelplot (incl. plotmap) now uses `useRaster`. This allows better control for
 falling back to `panel.levelplot`.

Minor changes 

o levelplot uses .wavelength factors for subsetting, grouping, conditioning: 
  thus the strips will display the wavelength value.

o extraction ([]) now warns if unused arguments are given

Experimental new features

o mixed colour map plots: qplotmixmap (experimental)

Bug fixes

o bugfix for unsigned long int in .spc files 

o stacked spectra plots label positions

Minor changes

o levelplot uses .wavelength factors for subsetting, grouping, conditioning: thus the strips will
  display the wavelength value.

Internal changes

o Documentation format is now roxygen2

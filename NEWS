User-visible changes 

o bugfix for stacked plots: y axis labels were in wrong order in some cases

o recycling in initialize: columns may (again) be initialized with a single value

o levelplot (incl. plotmap) now uses `useRaster`. This allows better control for falling back to
`panel.levelplot`.

Internal changes

o Documentation format is now roxygen2

User-visible changes 

o hyperSpec gains a subset method

o bugfix for stacked plots: y axis labels were in wrong order in some cases

o recycling in initialize: columns may (again) be initialized with a single value

o levelplot (incl. plotmap) now uses `useRaster`. This allows better control for falling back to
`panel.levelplot`.

Minor changes

o levelplot uses .wavelength factors for subsetting, grouping, conditioning: thus the strips will
  display the wavelength value.

Internal changes

o Documentation format is now roxygen2
